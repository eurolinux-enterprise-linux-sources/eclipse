This project should provide a simplified build for the Eclipse SDK on Linux 
distributions.  The current state is producing a usable eclipse build under build/(build Id)/installation. 
Tasks completed so far:
# Build pdebuild-ant and its dependencies in the directory bootstrap/plugins (not yet enabled by default)
# Generate source tarball of entire Eclipse SDK and required other files (buildSDKSource.sh)
# All plugins and features of org.eclipse.sdk built
# Use p2 publisher to create metadata for all built components
# Provision org.eclipse.sdk using p2 director

To test it do the following:

<!-- FIXME:  Include SVN instructions as an alternative -->
* generate source using <tt>./buildSource.sh</tt> (alternatively, look for 3.5.1 sources here:  http://download.eclipse.org/technology/linuxtools/eclipse-build/ -- get the tarball for 3.5.1:  eclipse-R3_5_1-fetched-src.tar.bz2 and verify its md5sum matches)
** <tt>./buildSource.sh -workdir /tmp/eclipseSDKBuild</tt>
* if you are using pre-generated source tarballs, check out basebuilder:
** <tt>mkdir -p /tmp/eclipseSDKBuild; cd /tmp/eclipseSDKBuild; cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/eclipse co -r R35_M7 org.eclipse.releng.basebuilder</tt>
* ensure the directory in which you are running the build contains the generated source tarball of the Eclipse SDK: eclipse-I20090611-1540-fetched-src.tar.bz2 .  A symlink is also acceptable.
* run the build using an existing basebuilder checkout ('''note''':  YOUR_ARCH should be in the way eclipse defines archs, e.g i*86 becomes x86, x86_64 is the same.  We have yet to test with other archs.  Any help is welcome.)
** <tt>java -jar <basebuilder>/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.0.200.v20090429-1630.jar -consolelog -data $(pwd)/baseworkspace -Duser.home=$(pwd)/userhome -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner -DbuildArch=YOUR_ARCH -DbaseBuilder=<basebuilder> -Dlauncher=<basebuilder>/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.0.200.v20090429-1630.jar -Declipse.pdebuild.scripts=<basebuilder>/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.0.v20090430-1420 -DskipFetch=true 2>&1 | tee build.log</tt>

You should get:
<!-- Not anymore.  We need to fix this.
* all the dependencies of pdebuild-ant in the bootstrap/plugins folder. -->
* working Eclipse SDK 3.5.1 build in build/(build Id)/installation directory
