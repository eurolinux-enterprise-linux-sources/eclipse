Eclipse-build aims at ease the building of the Eclipse SDK especially for Linux distributions. 

'''Detailed TODO:'''
* Fix broken features build.xml caused by source features/plugins generation. 
Workaround for now: Copy back the original after generation is done.
* Migrate plugins with custom build.xml files to customCallbacks.
* Check naming of org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty_1.1.0 with upstream. Version should 
not be part of the name. According to Kim Moir there are 2 equino.http.jetty plugins used in different
part of the build problem.
* Hook native compilation in the build.xml.
* Add a target to create an all-in-one tarball - srcIncluded zip, patches, missing bundles from srcIncluded and the build scripts 

'''Overall PLAN:'''
# Create a working build with upstream srcIncluded build.
# Create a script to fetch sources from cvs.
# Fix to properly build with the fetched sources.
# Put all patches we have in Fedora srpm here so other distros can easily reuse them.
Others are welcome.
