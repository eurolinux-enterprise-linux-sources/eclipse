'''About building the Eclipse SDK''' 

Building the Eclipse SDK is not a simple process. You can not simply download a
tarball from eclipse.org and build it. There are a lot of manual interactions 
needed.

'''About eclipse-build''' 

With eclipse-build we hope to simplify the build significantly.
Current plan is to create:
# Working ant build.
# Common place and infrastructure for storing/applying patches needed for clean build on various Linux distributions.
# Standardize the usage of system libraries. 

'''Patches and Bugs'''

We are always open to patches to document, clean up, or improve our process.  Please open a bug against Technology -> Linux Tools -> Packaging Tools with an attached patch.  Please put "&#91;eclipse-build&#93;" at the start of the bug title.  Here is a link to follow to open a bug:

'''Current status'''

As of 2009-06-22, it is possible to build the Eclipse SDK entirely from a tarball of the sources.  The build procedure is ''very'' similar to 
what is done by the upstream release engineers.  The resulting provisioned SDK can be run and have additional software installed into it.  See README.mediawiki for more information.
